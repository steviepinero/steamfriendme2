How does it work?
Steamfriend.me is a social networking service for PC/Linux/Mac gamers off the Steam digital distribution platform. What our application will do is match users as potential friends, 1-on-1, with other users that play similar games using user data drawn from the robust SteamAPI. Users will be matched based on the games they have on authentication already so they wonâ€™t have to input a single bit of data. After they are matched, the users are then given the option to rate their matches to improve future matches with other users.

Are you storing my information?
NO, your privacy is maitnained at all times, by signining up all you do is provide acces to your recently played games, just as you would to any other Steam user

How many games can I be matched with?
You can be matched with any game that you have in you 'recently played' game list. Currntly a mach can be made with one opponent at a time

Since you're looking at my recently played games, how far back are you looking?
We are reviewing you previously played games for the last two weeks and matching you with other players according to their recently played games
